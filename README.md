# DevAnyware

Docker xvnc+vscode-based cross-platform multi-language development toolchain.

DevAnyware includes VSCode, neovim, zsh, powershell-core, chromium, and many other tools. It is configured for, and includes tooling for development in a variety of languages and frameworks. It extends the ideas of Smalltalk to a more heterogeneous environment made up of composable tools, employing a unified interaction metaphor with a focus on keyboard navigation and auto-discovery of the command language. All you should need to know is that there is a trigger - tap and release the Windows key or Command key - and if you wait a moment the system will recognise your pause and give you guidance. Once you remember key sequences you no longer pause, and the system stays out of your way. But any time you forget, or are unsure, just pause and the guidance is there. The idea that this can be extended to every tool, including e.g. VSCode and VisualWorks Smalltalk, and the mechanism for doing so, is a fundamental realisation. The guidance idea is not new and is well demonstrated in e.g. spacemacs.

The unified interface mechanism is still under development, but it's already very useful.

- Python
